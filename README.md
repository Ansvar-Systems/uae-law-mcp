Query **UAE legislation** -- covering data protection, cybersecurity, corporate law, and more -- directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.

If you're building legal tech, compliance tools, or doing UAE legal research, this is your verified reference database.

Built by [Ansvar Systems](https://ansvar.eu) -- Stockholm, Sweden

## Why This Exists

UAE legal research is scattered across official government databases, commercial legal platforms, and institutional archives. Whether you're:
- A **lawyer** validating citations in a brief or contract
- A **compliance officer** checking if a statute is still in force
- A **legal tech developer** building tools on UAE law
- A **researcher** tracing legislative history

...you shouldn't need dozens of browser tabs and manual PDF cross-referencing. Ask Claude. Get the exact provision. With context.

This MCP server makes UAE law **searchable, cross-referenceable, and AI-readable**.

## Quick Start

### Use Remotely (No Install Needed)

> Connect directly to the hosted version -- zero dependencies, nothing to install.

**Endpoint:** `https://uae-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp`

| Client | How to Connect |
|--------|---------------|
| **Claude.ai** | Settings > Connectors > Add Integration > paste URL |
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add uae-law --transport http https://uae-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp` |
| **Claude Desktop** | Add to config (see below) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Add to VS Code settings (see below) |

**Claude Desktop** -- add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uae-law": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://uae-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**GitHub Copilot** -- add to VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
    "uae-law": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://uae-law-mcp.vercel.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Locally (npm)

```bash
npx @ansvar/uae-law-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop** -- add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uae-law": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ansvar/uae-law-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor / VS Code:**

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "uae-law": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ansvar/uae-law-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Queries

Once connected, just ask naturally:

- *"What does the UAE data protection law say about consent?"*
- *"Search for cybersecurity requirements in UAE legislation"*
- *"Is this statute still in force?"*
- *"Find provisions about personal data in UAE law"*
- *"What EU directives does this UAE law implement?"*
- *"Which UAE laws implement the GDPR?"*
- *"Validate this legal citation"*
- *"Build a legal stance on data breach notification requirements"*

## Available Tools (13)

### Core Legal Research Tools (8)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_legislation` | FTS5 full-text search across all provisions with BM25 ranking |
| `get_provision` | Retrieve specific provision by statute + chapter/section |
| `check_currency` | Check if statute is in force, amended, or repealed |
| `validate_citation` | Validate citation against database (zero-hallucination check) |
| `build_legal_stance` | Aggregate citations from statutes for a legal topic |
| `format_citation` | Format citations per UAE conventions (full/short/pinpoint) |
| `list_sources` | List all available statutes with metadata |
| `about` | Server info, capabilities, and coverage summary |

### EU/International Law Integration Tools (5)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_eu_basis` | Get EU directives/regulations for UAE statute |
| `get_uae_implementations` | Find UAE laws implementing EU act |
| `search_eu_implementations` | Search EU documents with UAE implementation counts |
| `get_provision_eu_basis` | Get EU law references for specific provision |
| `validate_eu_compliance` | Check implementation status of EU directives |

---

## Why This Works

**Verbatim Source Text (No LLM Processing):**
- All statute text is ingested from official UAE government sources
- Provisions are returned **unchanged** from SQLite FTS5 database rows
- Zero LLM summarization or paraphrasing -- the database contains regulation text, not AI interpretations

**Smart Context Management:**
- Search returns ranked provisions with BM25 scoring (safe for context)
- Provision retrieval gives exact text by statute identifier + chapter/section
- Cross-references help navigate without loading everything at once

**Technical Architecture:**
```
Official Sources --> Parse --> SQLite --> FTS5 snippet() --> MCP response
                     ^                       ^
              Provision parser         Verbatim database query
```

### Traditional Research vs. This MCP

| Traditional Approach | This MCP Server |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Search official databases by statute number | Search by plain language |
| Navigate multi-chapter statutes manually | Get the exact provision with context |
| Manual cross-referencing between laws | `build_legal_stance` aggregates across sources |
| "Is this statute still in force?" --> check manually | `check_currency` tool --> answer in seconds |
| Find EU basis --> dig through EUR-Lex | `get_eu_basis` --> linked EU directives instantly |
| No API, no integration | MCP protocol --> AI-native |

## Important Disclaimers

### Legal Advice

> **THIS TOOL IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE**
>
> Statute text is sourced from official UAE government publications. However:
> - This is a **research tool**, not a substitute for professional legal counsel
> - **Court case coverage is limited** -- do not rely solely on this for case law research
> - **Verify critical citations** against primary sources for court filings
> - **EU cross-references** are extracted from statute text, not EUR-Lex full text

**Before using professionally, read:** [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) | [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### Client Confidentiality

Queries go through the Claude API. For privileged or confidential matters, use on-premise deployment.
