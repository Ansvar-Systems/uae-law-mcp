# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer, legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: UAE Lawyers Association members must comply with applicable professional conduct rules when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (Ministry of Justice (moj.gov.ae), DIFC/ADGM)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force and has not been amended
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting case law and preparatory works for interpretation
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official UAE legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Official government databases** | Authoritative | Statute text (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources** | Supplementary | Case law, cross-references (verify independently) |
| **EUR-Lex / treaty databases** | Authoritative for international law | International obligations metadata |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- Tamimi Law, Al Tamimi & Company, Lexis Middle East

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations, and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- UAE law changes continuously through new statutes, amendments, and court decisions
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" may have been:
  - Amended after the last database update
  - Repealed but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional rules affecting its applicability
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law** -- Coverage is limited; do not rely solely on this for case law research
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording
3. **Legal commentary** -- No editorial annotations, academic commentary, or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative rulings largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of preparatory works and explanatory memoranda

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without commentary and preparatory works, interpretation may be incorrect
- **International Law Blind Spots**: Cannot fully assess international treaty obligations or compliance

## No Warranties

### "AS IS" -- No Guarantees

Per the Apache 2.0 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)):

- **NO WARRANTY OF ACCURACY**: Data may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information

**Human review is MANDATORY** before relying on any AI-generated search results or analysis.
